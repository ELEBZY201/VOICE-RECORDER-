This Python code defines a simple voice recorder application using the tkinter GUI toolkit for the interface and PyAudio for recording audio from the microphone. Here's a summary of how it works:
1.	It imports necessary libraries including os, wave, time, threading, tkinter, and pyaudio
2.	It defines a class VoiceRecorder which encapsulates the functionality of the voice recorder.
3.	The VoiceRecorder class initializes a Tkinter window with a large button (ðŸŽ™) to start and stop recording and a label to display the recording duration.
4.	Clicking the button toggles recording on and off.
5.	When recording is initiated, it starts a new thread to handle the recording process.
6.	The record() method continuously reads audio data from the microphone using PyAudio, updating the recording duration displayed on the label.
7.	When recording is stopped, it stops the audio stream, closes PyAudio, and saves the recorded audio as a WAV file named "recordingX.wav" where X is an incremental number to avoid overwriting existing files.
Overall, the code provides a basic interface for recording audio from the microphone and saving it to WAV files in a sequential manner.
